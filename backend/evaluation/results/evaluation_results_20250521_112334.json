      "One of the key figures in the American documentary film, released in 2015, directed by Malcolm Ingram, played college basketball for Stanford University before being drafted 18th overall pick for the New Jersey Nets.",
      "Yes, surface porosity and pore size do influence the mechanical properties and cellular response to PEEK. The micro-CT analysis showed that PEEK-SP with different pore sizes had varying mechanical properties, including tensile strength and interfacial shear strength. Additionally, PEEK-SP exhibited greater proliferation and cell-mediated mineralization compared to smooth PEEK and Ti6Al4V. Introducing porosity to PEEK implants can enhance osseointegration while preserving strength, which is crucial for the implant's ability to bear physiologic loads. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of pore size on both mechanical properties and cellular response to PEEK.",
      "Yes, based on the context provided in the software license and maintenance agreement:\n\nSection 2 - Grant of License states that Sparkling's right to use the Software and Documentation at locations other than the Authorized Locations is subject to the payment of additional fees in accordance with the Fee Schedule.\n\nThis indicates that if Sparkling wants to use the licensed software and documentation at locations beyond the Authorized Locations listed in Schedule C, they would need to pay additional fees as outlined in the Fee Schedule.\n\nSo there is a requirement for Sparkling to pay additional fees if they want to expand their use of the licensed software and documentation beyond the initially authorized locations.",
      "The rate of return in Cadence Design Systems Inc. from 2010 to 2011 is 37.9%. This is calculated by taking the value on 1/1/2011 (137.90) and subtracting the initial investment value on 1/2/2010 (100.00).",
      "Yes, there is a specific format for COBOL copybooks to be used in IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX). In the context provided, it is mentioned that when installing IBM WTX Design Studio 8.4.1.1 over an existing installation, the COBOL Copybook importer may be missing after the upgrade. This issue occurs because some files are not correctly overwritten or modified during the upgrade process. To resolve this problem, it is recommended to install WTX Design Studio 8.4.1.1 in an empty directory and then perform any installation customization. Following this procedure should ensure that the COBOL Copybook importer functions properly in the WTX environment."

      "The Brooklyn Nets are an American professional basketball team based in Brooklyn, New York. They are a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team plays its home games at the Barclays Center. The franchise was founded as the New Jersey Americans in 1967, and was one of the eleven original American Basketball Association (ABA) teams. In its second ABA season, Arthur Brown, the team owner, moved the team to Long Island and renamed it the New York Nets. The team won ABA championships in 1974 and 1976. When the ABA merged with the NBA in 1976, the Nets were one of four ABA teams admitted into the NBA. The team was moved to the Rutgers Athletic Center in New Jersey; after the 1976\u201377 NBA season, the team was renamed the New Jersey Nets. Since they joined the NBA, the Nets have won 4\u00a0divisional championships, 2\u00a0conference championships and appeared in the playoffs 16\u00a0times.

Garman agrees to indemnify Sparkling and hold it harmless from any and all losses, damages and expenses including without limitation, court costs, arbitration fees, penalties, fines, amounts paid in settlement of claims and reasonable legal fees and expenses of investigation (collectively the \"Losses\") which Sparkling or any of its respective officers or directors may incur due to a breach of this warranty. Sparkling shall notify Garman in writing of any such claim within ten calendar days of a responsible officer of Sparkling becoming aware of such claim. If the Work or any portion thereof is held to constitute an infringement of another Person's rights, and use thereof is enjoined, Garman shall, at its election and expense, make every reasonable effort to correct the situation with minimal effect upon the operations of Sparkling and shall either:\n\n     (a)    procure the right to use the infringing element of the Work;\n\n     (b)    procure the right to an element which performs the same function without any material loss of functionality; or\n\n     (c)    replace or modify the element of the Work so that the infringing portion is no longer infringing and still performs the same function without any material loss of functionality.\n\n14.

Confidential Information means all data and information related to the business and management of either party, including proprietary and trade secrets, technology and accounting records for which access is obtained by the other party pursuant to this Agreement, provided that such Confidential Information shall not include data or information which:\n\n     (a)    is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the other party;\n\n     (b)    is already in the rightful possession of the other party prior to its receipt from the other party;\n\n     (c)    is independently developed by the other party;\n\n     (d)    is lawfully obtained by the other party from a third party;\n\n     (e)    is disclosed as required by law; or\n\n     (f)    is disclosed to professional advisors in confidence.\n\n                                                                          PAGE 7\n\n     The parties agree to hold each other's Confidential Information in confidence. The parties agree not to make each other's Confidential Information available in any form to any third party or to use each other's Confidential Information for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement. Each party agrees to take all reasonable steps to ensure the Confidential Information is not disclosed or distributed by its employees or agents in violation of this Section.\n\n15.  LIMITATION OF GARMAN'S LIABILITY\n\n     The exclusive remedy of either party in a claim against the other under this Agreement shall be the recovery of its direct damages. In no event shall either party be liable to the other for the recovery of any special, indirect or consequential damages even if the defendant party had been advised of the possibility of such damages including but not limited to lost profits, lost revenues, failure to realize expected savings, loss of data and loss of use. The parties agree that the limitation of liability in this paragraph reflects the allocation of risk between the parties and the price of the licenced Software. The limitation of liability in this Section 15 shall not apply to breaches of Sections 13 and 14.\n\n16.  SOURCE CODE ESCROW\n\n\n\n\n\n     (a)    Immediately upon execution of this Agreement, Garman shall maintain on each AS400 at an Authorized Location the most current version of:\n\n            (1)   all source code for the Software in machine readable form,                   with user option to print;\n\n            (2)   all program and user documentation in machine readable and                   printed form;\n\n            (3)   all tools such as compilers, assemblers, linkers and editors                   required to make the source code into the functional Software                   operating in accordance with the Specifications as amended                   from time to time;\n\n            (4)   a complete explanation of any procedures that are not standard                   practice, required to create from the source code the                   functional Software; (5) all documentation listing program and                   module inputs and their sources, outputs and their                   destinations, and any other relevant program and module                   documentation,\n\n(collectively, the \"Codes\").\n\n                                                                          PAGE 8\n\n     This Source Code shall remain the property of Garman unless Sparkling exercises its option to purchase as specified in the Source Code Agreement. The Source Code on each AS400 shall be the most current version of all Codes for all corrections, bug fixes, Improvements and new releases of the Software which are licensed by Sparkling hereunder.
